plot bp vs ptt

sig_index input

tensorboard
  surrogate losses (cvp, pap, etc)
  correlation plot
  4 stage classification
  hypertension SS
  percent within 15, 10, 5

more pressure waveform outputs
  only apply loss when present
    

smooth bp

data augmentation
  randomly slide ppg and resp

age
gender
height
weight
death during stay
ethnicity  
icd_codes

prescriptions
inputs
glucose, hematocrit, creatinine,
electrolytes: potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium

halve chunk_size

:1024:2 finetuned on :512:1
validate by subject_id, hadm_id
normalize to account for varying waveform counts

curriculum
  512:1 -> 1024:2 -> 1024:1
  shrink target region over time
